Apache support event, worker and pefork

1. Does the system support threads?

2. Does the system support thread-safe polling (Specifically, the kqueue and epoll functions)?

If the answer to both questions is 'yes', the default MPM is event.

If The answer to #1 is 'yes', but the answer to #2 is 'no', the default will be worker.

If the answer to both questions is 'no', then the default MPM will be prefork.
